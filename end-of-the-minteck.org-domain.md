# End of the "minteck.org" domain

The minteck.org domain was initially acquired back in October 2021 to host services that were then managed by "Minteck" or "Pawer Technologies". Since then, the birth of Equestria.dev and its aquisition of Pawer Technologies and all the associated products have led to a decline in the use of minteck.org

Therefore, Equestria.dev will be **discontinuing minteck.org in October 2025**. Make sure all email address or links pointing to minteck.org are updated before this date. minteck.org will redirect to this page until the domain expires, after which it will be available for anyone to buy.

_Equestria.dev shall not be held responsible for any damage caused by the use of the minteck.org domain after October 1, 2025._
